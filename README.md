ToDo list that saves your value to Local Storage.

    In this project, I was tasked to create JavaScript using Jquery to
    Save whatever value the user enters in the text box, and add it to local storage. In the header, It will notify the user that their entry has been saved to local storage, as well as the live date displayed as well.

Getting Started

    To get started with this project, I downloaded node JS then IusedNPM and referenced Jquery. 

Here Is what it looks like!
